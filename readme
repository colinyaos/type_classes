implementation of type classes in sml

Basic structure of individual terms is in typeclass.sml. 
The specification for the data structure of instances of type classes is in numd.sml. 
The main logic of the program is in eval.sml:
    - type_applicator looks up the type in the typeclass instance, either returning the appropriate function or performing a currying step to ensure type safety
    - eval is the main function that evaluates the expression, using type_applicator to perform the appropriate operations

Some notes about syntax
    - Parser does not currently support order of operations. All binary operations must be parenthesized.
